        <h1>Problem Solving Reflection</h1>

        <h2>1. A time I was blocked on a simple problem</h2>
        <p>
          I was trying to return "FlipFlop" for numbers divisible by 3 and 5,
          but my code was returning "Flip" instead. I used console logging, read
          the test expectations again, and talked through my logic out loud. I
          felt a bit stuck at first, but once I slowed down, I figured it out. I
          learned that the order of conditions really matters when writing
          if/else logic.
        </p>

        <h2>2. A time I elegantly solved a problem</h2>
        <p>
          I had to write a function to capitalize the first letter of each word
          in a sentence. I used pseudocode to plan it, then used
          <code>.split()</code>, <code>.map()</code>, and
          <code>.join()</code> to write a clean one-liner. It worked first try,
          and I felt confident and focused while writing it. I learned how
          useful planning is — it can really speed things up.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Reflecting on my confidence with problem-solving techniques</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Pseudocode</strong>: Confident. Helps me plan and think
            clearly before coding.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Trying something</strong>: Comfortable. Experimenting often
            leads me toward a solution.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Rubber ducky method</strong>: Surprisingly effective!
            Talking through it helps me catch mistakes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Reading error messages</strong>: Getting better. Slowing
            down and actually reading them helps a lot.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Console.logging</strong>: Very confident. It’s my default
            tool for figuring out what’s going on.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Googling</strong>: Confident. Great for syntax and checking
            method usage.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Asking peers for help</strong>: Still building confidence,
            but I know it’s valuable when I do.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Asking coaches for help</strong>: Sometimes nervous, but
            always helpful when I go for it.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Improving my process with reflection</strong>: Reflection
            helps me notice patterns and improve over time.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. A time I was reluctant to ask for help</h2>
        <p>
          I once spent about 45 minutes stuck on a test that wouldn’t pass. I
          kept thinking I should be able to figure it out myself. Eventually, I
          asked for help and it turned out to be a small typo. Next time, I’ll
          give myself a 15–20 minute limit, if I’m still stuck, I’ll reach out.
          I’m learning that asking isn’t a weakness — it speeds up the learning
          process.
