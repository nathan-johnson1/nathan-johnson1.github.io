        <h2>Foundations Learning Plan</h2>

        <h3>1. What is your long-term goal or career pathway?</h3>
        <p>
          My long-term goal is to hopefully build a career in software
          development and hopefully succeed in sticking to this pathway and
          eventually becoming an experienced programmer.
        </p>

        <h3>
          2. A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
          learning
        </h3>
        <p>
          I think my strengths when it comes to learning are that I am able to
          stay focused on a task and responsibly manage my time. My limitations
          are that I sometimes can do a limited amount of research or just the
          bare minimum required to complete a task and I don’t always absorb all
          of the information I need.
        </p>

        <h3>
          3. What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see
          developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
        </h3>
        <p>
          I would specifically like to see myself improve in teamwork aspects
          and effectively communicating well with my peers. I also need to learn
          to ask for help more and know when I’m stuck and need help.
        </p>

        <h3>
          4. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme
        </h3>

        <h4>How I will work productively and safely with others</h4>
        <p>
          I will manage myself by communicating clearly with peers and
          facilitators, meeting deadlines, and staying organized. I’ll
          contribute to group projects respectfully, follow coding best
          practices, and ensure a safe and inclusive environment, both online
          and in person.
        </p>

        <h4>
          What I will do when things are building up and starting to get to me
        </h4>
        <p>
          The best way for me to relax myself when things are getting to me is
          to just take a small break, by either going for a small drive, or a
          walk to the kitchen for a cup of coffee.
        </p>

        <h3>
          5. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
        </h3>
        <p>
          My first course of action for seeking help is to first head to google
          and see if anyone else has had the same issues as me, or I will go to
          the discord help desk channel and ask for help.
        </p>

        <h3>6. A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
        <p>
          From the facilitation team, I would only expect timely replies when I
          ask for help, or constructive feedback to my work, but I understand I
          have to take initiative for my own learning and control my own
          workflow accordingly.
        </p>

        <h3>7. Any scheduling information such as block-out times</h3>
        <p>
          I do not have any serious commitments at the moment, but I may have
          one-off events where I am unavailable to study.
        </p>

        <h2>Bootcamp Learning Plan</h2>

        <h3>1. What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
        <p>
          My long-term goal is to become a confident, full-time software
          developer working in a team where I can keep growing and building
          real-world projects.
        </p>

        <h3>
          2. What are you hoping to use the skills you gain during this course
          for? What impact would you like to make once you leave Dev Academy? Do
          you have a destination in mind?
        </h3>
        <p>
          I want to use these skills to contribute meaningfully to a dev team,
          ideally in a junior developer role. I’d love to eventually work on
          tools or software that help people solve real problems.
        </p>

        <h3>
          3. What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in
          Bootcamp?
        </h3>
        <p>
          I’m good at managing my time and staying focused. But I can struggle
          with asking for help or reaching out when stuck, which I’ll need to
          improve during Bootcamp.
        </p>

        <h3>
          4. Re-evaluate your strengths and limitations from Sprint 2. Has your
          idea of these changed throughout Foundations? Have you discovered any
          new ones during this course? How do you think these will help/hinder
          you during Bootcamp?
        </h3>
        <p>
          My strengths still include focus and independence, but Foundations
          helped me see how important collaboration is. I’ve also noticed I can
          overthink things when working alone, so checking in with others will
          help keep me grounded during Bootcamp.
        </p>

        <h3>
          5. What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp
          will be?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Probably staying balanced with the intensity of the schedule. Also
          adjusting to more regular teamwork after mostly working solo.
        </p>

        <h3>
          6. What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see
          developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
        </h3>
        <p>
          I’d like to get better at asking for help, pairing with others, and
          giving/receiving feedback without overthinking it.
        </p>

        <h3>7. What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
        <p>
          Mainly clear guidance when needed and timely support if I raise
          something. I also value honest feedback.
        </p>

        <h3>8. What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</h3>
        <p>
          To stay engaged, communicate clearly, and be proactive, especially in
          group situations or when stuck.
        </p>

        <h3>
          9. Based on your knowledge of Bootcamp, how and where will you seek
          help in a timely way?
        </h3>
        <p>
          I’ll use Discord, talk to peers, and reach out to facilitators. I’ll
          aim not to sit stuck for too long before asking.
        </p>

        <h3>
          10. Write down a commitment to how you will manage your workload in
          this programme.
        </h3>
        <p>
          I’ll manage my workload by planning each day, staying organised, and
          communicating with my team. I’ll take short breaks to avoid burnout
          and check in regularly with others to stay on track.
