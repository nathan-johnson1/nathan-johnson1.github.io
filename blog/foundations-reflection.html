        <h2>
          1. What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your
          ego due to the Human Skills learning?
        </h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            I’ve noticed that I put a lot of pressure on myself to solve things
            alone, and I don’t always ask for help when I probably should, even
            when it would save time.
          </li>
          <li>
            Working solo has made me realise how easy it is to get stuck in my
            own head. I’m learning that collaboration is something I want to
            grow into, not avoid.
          </li>
          <li>
            I’ve started to reflect more on how I respond to challenge and
            frustration, and I’m hoping that as I begin working with others,
            I’ll be more open, curious, and receptive.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>
          2. What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in
          learning and programming?
        </h2>
        <p>
          They help build better collaboration. Programming is rarely solo,
          understanding others, being patient, and knowing how you respond under
          pressure makes teamwork smoother and more respectful.
        </p>

        <h2>
          3. What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Honestly, how relevant it is. I expected it to be separate from
          coding, but it’s been just as important, especially during pair
          programming or group work where communication is everything.
        </p>

        <h2>
          4. What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills
          learning?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Slowing down to reflect was surprisingly challenging. I’m used to
          focusing on solving problems or writing code, so stepping back to
          think about mindset, habits, or how I react to challenges felt
          unfamiliar at first. It took some effort to be honest with myself.
        </p>

        <h2>
          5. Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much
          time focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp
          course?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Because technical skill isn’t enough in real-world teams. Projects
          succeed or fail based on communication, collaboration, and mindset,
          not just code.
        </p>

        <h2>
          6. Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel
          like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise
          programming instead? Justify your answer.
        </h2>
        <p>
          Not a waste at all. It made me a more balanced learner. Knowing
          JavaScript is great, but being able to explain my thinking, handle
          feedback, and work well with others is what makes me actually
          job-ready.
